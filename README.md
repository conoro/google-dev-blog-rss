# An RSS feed for the Google Developer Blog because these things matter

Courtesy of ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot (and a tiny bit of Conor), here's a [basic RSS feed](https://conoro.github.io/google-dev-blog-rss/rss/bring_back_reader.xml) for the [Google Developer Blog](https://developer.chrome.com/blog).

It runs on GitHub Actions and is generated once an hour.

The MIME type may be wrong which may mess up some RSS readers but it works fine in [Feedly](https://feedly.com).

You can subscribe to the RSS feed this URL: https://conoro.github.io/google-dev-blog-rss/rss/bring_back_reader.xml
