# An RSS feed for the Google Developer Blog because these things matter

Courtesy of ChatGPT and GitHub CoPilot (and a tiny bit of Conor), here's a basic RSS feed for the [Google Developer Blog](https://developer.chrome.com/blog).

It runs on GitHub Actions and is generated once an hour.

The MIME type may be wrong which may mess up some RSS readers but it works fine in [Feedly](https://feedly.com).
